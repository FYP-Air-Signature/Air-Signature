# Air Signature

A new way of signing digitally, where the user moves the index finger in front of a **camera** that captures and tracks the motion. The actual problem is identifying the finger movements (dots, swipes) is so difficult. This feature is more expected in the current fully digital world. Clients will be able to their signature style using a small webcam without any objects.
